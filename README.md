# Sweet-Shop


A full-stack web application with **React (Vite) frontend**, **Node.js backend**, **Prisma ORM**, and **PostgreSQL database**.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

-   `frontend/`: Contains the vite.js frontend application.
-   `backend/`: Contains the Node.js backend server with Prisma ORM.

## ðŸ“– Project Explanation

Sweet-Shop is an online store application built as a full-stack project.  
- The **frontend** is built with **React + Vite + TypeScript**, styled with **TailwindCSS**, and uses **lucide-react** for icons.  
- The **backend** is built with **Node.js + Express**, featuring **JWT authentication with cookies**.  
- **Prisma ORM** is used to interact with a **PostgreSQL** database for structured and reliable data storage.  
- **Zod** is used for validation, **bcrypt** for password hashing, and **axios** for API calls.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)
-   A database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) for the backend.

#ðŸ¤– My AI Usage

For this project, I leveraged AI tools to accelerate development and debugging:

Claude AI:

Used to generate the initial frontend skeleton and UI components in Svelte.

Helped bootstrap layouts and structure for the project quickly.

ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-5):

Assisted in solving errors, debugging backend issues, and refining Prisma/Postgres integration.

Helped polish the README.md and improve documentation clarity.

Reflection

Using AI tools made my workflow significantly more efficient:

Faster prototyping: Claude helped me quickly set up a functional UI skeleton.

Error resolution: ChatGPT guided me through debugging issues that would have otherwise taken longer to research.

Documentation: ChatGPT helped create structured and professional documentation.

However, I made sure to review, understand, and modify all AI-generated code before committing it, ensuring I stayed in control of the projectâ€™s logic and quality. AI acted as a pair programmer/assistant, not as a replacement for understanding.
